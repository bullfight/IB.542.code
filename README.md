IB 542 - Climate Modeling Functions
====================

About These Files
---------------------
In working through learning to use the functions, in (Campbell & Norman, 1998), I am coding the function in R.  I thought it would be handy, if I could share these functions.  To go with this, I have included a file called learnR.R to work you through much of the introductory to programming with R, specifically in the context of a temperature record data set.

* [learnR.R](http://github.com/bullfight/IB.542.code/blob/master/learnR.R). - a script you can work through to learn using R
* [run.model.R](http://github.com/bullfight/IB.542.code/blob/master/run.model.R). - a bare bones script for running functions learned about in [learnR.R](http://github.com/bullfight/IB.542.code/blob/master/learnR.R)

### data
* [2010.SoyFace.micromet.sample.csv](http://github.com/bullfight/IB.542.code/blob/master/2010.SoyFace.micromet.sample.csv) 10 days of temperature record (Ta - Airtemp and Ts - Tsoil)

### functions
* [model.Functions.R](http://github.com/bullfight/IB.542.code/blob/master/model.Functions.R) contains functions we will use

*you will need to download the files and open them in the R software*

Get R up and going on your computer
---------------------

### You will need to download and install one of the following packages

* [R for Mac OS X](http://cran.r-project.org/bin/macosx/).
* [R for Windows](http://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/).

### Run the program
* the following screenshots were taken on OS X, Windows is a bit different, but the premise is the same


This is the console
